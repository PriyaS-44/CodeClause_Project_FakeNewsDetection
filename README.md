# CodeClause_project_FakeNewsDetection
I have attached the completion code on the task "Fake News Detection" as a Data Science Intern at CodeClause. The prediction is done using a political dataset, implementing Tfidfvectorizer and intializing PassiveAggressiveClassifer. The prediction has given an accuracy of  92.9% magnitude.
